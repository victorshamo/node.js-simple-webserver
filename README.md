# node.js-simple-webserver

- A simple webserver made purely with Node.js.

- The idea was to navigate through the pages and log an id, the type of request(which in this case was only a GET request), and to log any errors into two different .txt files.

- Express was not used for this project, but it would have made things way easier and cleaner.
